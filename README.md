- 👋 Hi, I’m Maxfield England!
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software development experience—I love AI, but my biggest motivation is always being able to make an impact and benefit others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a variety of full-stack frameworks, working on my Android development, NodeJS and Machine Learning skills. 
- 💞️ I’m very open and flexible when it comes to developing professional experience; I'm happy just to be working with code.
- 📫 I can be reached via email at maxfieldengland@gmail.com
